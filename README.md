# The Great Spill Tracker
You got a friend, co-worker, significant other, etc. that always spills?  Well the entire point of this app is to track these spills (and help me learn a bit about making a Blazor app).  
Currently the app mainly serves to just keep track of time since the last spill at home or work, along with a few stats of longest and shortest time between spills.  
I am planning to add some additional functionality like keeping track of what was spilled and placing the data into a database.
